# jamvm_mingw
[WIP] My JamVM and GNU Classpath mingw build, not god just for fun

## How to build and run
* Not sure, I just build it with my msys_v11, other mingw toolchains are not tested  
* Before make test and make test2, need to copy copy_to_c_pan/**/*.so to C:/  

## TODO
* Remove jamvm-2.0.0/lib/libz.a
* Don't need to copy copy_to_c_pan/**/*.so (merge into exe)
* Compiled with msys2
